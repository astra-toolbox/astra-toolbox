The 'stlTools' toolbox is a collection of functions, samples and demos to illustrate how to deal with STL files. Some of them are contributions published in Matlab Central and properly referenced here.
This toolbox contains the following files:

stlGetFormat:	identifies the format of the STL file and returns 'binary' or 'ascii'. This file is inspired in the 'READ-stl' file written and published by Adam H. Aitkenhead (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27390-mesh-voxelisation). Copyright (c) 2013, Adam H. Aitkenhead.
stlReadAscii:	reads an STL file written in ascii format. This file is inspired in the 'READ-stl' file written and published by Adam H. Aitkenhead (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27390-mesh-voxelisation). Copyright (c) 2013, Adam H. Aitkenhead
stlReadBinary:	reads an STL file written in binary format. This file is inspired in the 'READ-stl' file written and published by Adam H. Aitkenhead (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27390-mesh-voxelisation). Copyright (c) 2013, Adam H. Aitkenhead
stlRead:	uses 'stlGetFormat', 'stlReadAscii' and 'stlReadBinary' to make STL reading independent of the format of the file
stlWrite:	writes an STL file in 'ascii' or 'binary' formats. This is written and published by Sven Holcombe (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20922-stlwrite-filename--varargin-). Copyright (c) 2012, Grant Lohsen. Copyright (c) 2015, Sven Holcombe.
stlSlimVerts:	finds and removes duplicated vertices. This function is written and published by Francis Esmonde-White as PATCHSLIM (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29986-patch-slim--patchslim-m-). Copyright (c) 2011, Francis Esmonde-White.
stlGetVerts:	returns a list of vertices that are 'opened' or 'closed' depending on the 'mode' input parameter. An 'open' vertice is the one that defines an open side. An open side is the one that only takes part of one triangle
stlDelVerts:	removes a list of vertices from STL files 
stlAddVerts:	adds the new vertices from a list (and consequently, new faces) to a STL object
stlPlot:	is an easy way to plot an STL object
stlDemo:	is a collection of examples about how to use stlTools
femur_binary:	is an ascii STL sample used in 'stlDemo'. It is published by Eric Johnson (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22409-stl-file-reader). Copyright (c) 2011, Eric Johnson.
sphere_ascii:	is a binary STL sample
