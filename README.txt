The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB and Python toolbox of high-performance GPU
primitives for 2D and 3D tomography.

We support 2D parallel and fan beam geometries, and 3D parallel and cone beam.
All of them have highly flexible source/detector positioning.

A large number of 2D and 3D algorithms are available, including FBP, SIRT,
SART, CGLS.

The basic forward and backward projection operations are GPU-accelerated, and
directly callable from MATLAB and Python to enable building new algorithms.

Installation instructions:
---------------------------


Windows, binary:
-----------------

Add the mex and tools subdirectories to your matlab path and the Python module
to your Python path.



Linux, from source:
--------------------

For Matlab:

Requirements: g++, boost, CUDA (5.5 or higher), Matlab (R2012a or higher)

cd build/linux
./autogen.sh   # when building a git version
./configure --with-cuda=/usr/local/cuda \
            --with-matlab=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a \
            --prefix=$HOME/astra \
            --with-install-type=module
make
make install

Add $HOME/astra/matlab and its subdirectories (tools, mex) to your matlab path.

If you want to build the Octave interface instead of the Matlab interface,
specify --enable-octave instead of --with-matlab=... . The Octave files
will be installed into $HOME/astra/octave .


NB: Each matlab version only supports a specific range of g++ versions.
Despite this, if you have a newer g++ and if you get errors related to missing
GLIBCXX_3.4.xx symbols, it is often possible to work around this requirement
by deleting the version of libstdc++ supplied by matlab in
MATLAB_PATH/bin/glnx86 or MATLAB_PATH/bin/glnxa64 (at your own risk),
or setting LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (or similar) when starting
matlab.


For Python:

Requirements: g++, boost, CUDA (5.5 or higher), Python (2.7 or 3.x)

cd build/linux
./autogen.sh   # when building a git version
./configure --with-cuda=/usr/local/cuda \
            --with-python \
            --with-install-type=module
make
make install

This will install Astra into your current Python environment.





Windows, from source using Visual Studio 2008:
-----------------------------------------------

Requirements: Visual Studio 2008, boost, CUDA (driver+toolkit), matlab.
Note that a .zip with all required (and precompiled) boost files is
  available from our website.

Set the environment variable MATLAB_ROOT to your matlab install location.
Open astra_vc08.sln in Visual Studio.
Select the appropriate solution configuration.
  (typically Release_CUDA|win32 or Release_CUDA|x64)
Build the solution.
Install by copying AstraCuda32.dll or AstraCuda64.dll from bin/ and
  all .mexw32 or .mexw64 files from bin/Release_CUDA or bin/Debug_CUDA
  and the entire matlab/tools directory to a directory to be added to
  your matlab path.
